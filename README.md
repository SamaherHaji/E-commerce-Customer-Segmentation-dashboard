# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation-dashboard

## Overview

This project focuses on segmenting e-commerce customers based on their transactional behavior and demographic features.  
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups and provide insights into the dataset by designing an informative dashboard for stakeholders—such as business managers and marketing teams—to help them make data-driven decisions.

## Dashboard Insights

Some of the insights the dashboard includes:

- **Customer Demographics**: A breakdown of customers by gender and city.
- **Coupon Usage**: Insights into coupon transaction status (e.g., claimed vs. burnt coupons) over time.
- **Top-performing Cities/Branches**: Cities or branches with the highest number of successful coupon burns.
- **Customer Retention and Loyalty**: Patterns in customer coupon usage frequency and trends over time.
